### Background and Design Goals

The Good Reads site has been in existance since 2007. Using the site’s lists and social networking features, book lovers can find new selections, recommend their favorites to others, and rate, catalogue and make lists of their own favorite books to share with others.

The site in its current state includes an extensive number of features, many of which are hard to find and unwieldy. The existing design also lacks hierarchy in color, typography and graphics. The repetitive nature of listing books and their lengthy metadata offers a bland, flat experience for the user.

The goal of this website redesign was to create a more appealing user experience that would integrate two major user goals––finding new books and sharing favorites with others—-via a bridging activity: the cataloguing and sorting of books into groups or "shelves." 

Essential to this goal was the creation of an overarching visual hierarchy to guide the user through the website in a seamless manner. The development of typographic and icon systems and an energetic color palette orders the information in an appealing way, while giving the site a light-hearted feel.

	column section

	Can the books and their column information
	be organized in a more interesting way?
	Can this information be more compelling?
	Is all the column information equally important?
	Could some of it be sidelined to another layer?

	potential solutions:
	grouping of a larger cover image along with the title 
	and the author’s name might make it more appealing.

	the remaining information—
	ratings, dates, and shelves—could be grouped in a similar way.
	This would avoid the long spread out columns which evoke the
	generic experience on Amazon and other shopping sites.

	left menu

	More consistent and parallel labeling/nomenclature needed,
	which allow for immediate and intuitive 
	understanding of the labels.

	shelves/ bookshelves ( one or the other)

	Tools  section

	list elements should be revised
	 to reflect more consistent 
	nomenclature for sections divided by 
	sorts of actions or content.
	for instance:

	Books I own
	Books and authors I recommend
	My most read authors

	Add Amazon book purchases
	import / export
	find duplicates
