As I start my research for our upcoming project: the redesign of the famous _Zen Garden_ site using only CSS (not touching the HTML), I know this will be an exercise in planning, and the use of pseudo-classes and pseudo elements.

In addition, the assignment is to recreate the character and feeling of a specific design period. Mine is postmodernism.
My initial reaction to the term is visions of postmodern archictecture from the 80s, with lots of bright pastels. 

But it’s much more than that. Its definition is by its very nature vague. It’s not a fixed movement, but a design movement in flux, defined by imprecise terms, and, by some interpretations, a reaction to a prior movement, more than a movement in itself.

For example from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:

	That postmodernism is indefinable is a truism. However, it can be described as a set of critical, strategic and rhetorical practices employing concepts such as difference, repetition, the trace, the simulacrum, and hyperreality to destabilize other concepts such as presence, identity, historical progress, epistemic certainty, and the univocity of meaning. 

Woah. What to make of that? Not sure.

But other reading leads me to this...

Post modernism is an attitude as much as it is a style. I’m going to approach it (at least initially) as primarily a _reaction_ to modernist (and other) assumptions of the certainty of scientific, or objective, efforts to explain reality.

Stay tuned, we’ll see what develops.
