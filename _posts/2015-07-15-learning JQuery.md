Today’s assignments included formulating 3 Codepens of JQuery actions on the redesign of the Goodreads website which we have been in the process of reconfiguring and redesigning in Illustrator CC. 

I’ve been able to follow the crux of the process as explained in the lecture by Aaron Larner yesterday afternoon. And more examples today didn’t seem to clarify the process further. I sat down with Abby our Instructor in training, who patiently explained again how to approach the process.

With her help, I was able to create the first  Codepen which collapses the descriptive content resting above a “shelf” or row of books on the site. 
(Click on the second book, first row.)
