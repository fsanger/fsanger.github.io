Today’s assignments included formulating 3 Codepens of JQuery actions on the redesign of the Goodreads website which we have been in the process of reconfiguring and redesigning in Illustrator CC. 

I’d been able to follow the crux of the process as explained in the lecture by Aaron Larner yesterday afternoon. However, more examples today didn’t seem to clarify the process further. I sat down with Abby Larner, our Instructor in Training, who patiently once again, went through how to approach the process.

With her help, I was able to create the first  Codepen which collapses the descriptive content resting above a “shelf” or row of books on the site. 
(Click on the second book, first row.)

The second Codepen was an attempt to assign an arrow selector to a specific “book” on the shelf. Aaron gave me lots of insights as I realized it would be difficult to assign an element to a selected book. In order to make this appear to happen, behind the scenes the arrow had to be attached to all books, then made to _disappear_ on all those not selected. A ’round about way of making this visual selection device function.

The third Codepen was to assign specific info to each of the books in the 2 shelves and have the appropriate info appear in the space above when the corresponding book cover was clicked on the shelf below. I left with an approach suggested by Aaron, but was frustrated in implementing it. The work in progress is below.
